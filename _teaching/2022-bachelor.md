**Intrusion Detection with Feature Code Base on Machine Learning**  

As the development of internet technology, more and more convenient
things have been taken into our life. Simultaneously, there are more
and more hazard of internet with it. Internet Intrusion, as the major
hazard in the cyber-security area, is already harm for the asset
security of people, even effect entire security of country. In the
work of Intrusion Detection, more and more institutes and scholars
devote into resist cyber intrusion. This research and experiments of
Anomaly Detection in Intrusion Detection attribute to the effort and
contribution of formers. Nowadays, there are two main branches of
Anomaly Detection, which are static feature detection and dynamic
feature detection. Thesis focus on a way of dynamic API detection in
dynamic feature detection, which is based on a Convolutional Auto
Encoder. On the basis of Convolutional Auto Encoder, thesis design a
kind of Stacked Convolutional Auto Encoder to collect feature before
classification intrusion with SVM algorithm, applying in Intrusion
Detection area. At the same time, it compares with Stacked Auto
Encoder algorithm and pure SVM algorithm.
